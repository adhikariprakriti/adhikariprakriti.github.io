## Work Experience

---
**Graduate Assistant | Myaamia Center, Miami University | Oxford, OH**
August 2024 – Present

- Lead the development of both frontend and backend features, encompassing the design and implementation of REST APIs, advanced search functionalities, analytics capabilities, and migration to AWS.

- Working on a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline functionality for 80% of core features, increasing cross-platform accessibility by 35%.

- Worked on a digital archive system capable of storing and managing historical linguistic data from 15 diverse indigenous communities, offering researchers 3 times greater accessibility.


**Software Engineer | Dialaxy | Kathmandu, Nepal October**  
October 2023 - May 2024
- Refactored front-end code by removing unnecessary libraries, updating to the latest packages, and integrating TypeScript for type safety while implementing modern Next.js features. These optimizations resulted in a bundle size reduction of over 200 KB and a decrease in page load times by nearly a second, significantly enhancing user experience and application efficiency.

- Developed and integrated a mobile dialer feature into a web application using React, WebRTC, and python, enabling real-time voice call capabilities (initiation, receiving, and call management functionalities). This addition contributed to a notable uptick in user engagement, with a marked reduction in customer support tickets, from 250 per month to under 170.

- Worked on CRM integration projects, including HubSpot and Pipedrive, to streamline customer relationship management processes by automating workflows and improving data synchronization, saving approximately 15 hours per week for the sales team.

**Software Engineer | Rara Labs | Lalitpur, Nepal**
May 2022 – October 2023
- Developed a microservice-oriented application using React and Go, implementing concurrent processing with Golang’s goroutines and channels to handle multithreaded operations and synchronization. This approach facilitated concurrent processing, handling up to 1,000 requests per second with minimal bottlenecks, measured by a consistent drop in
response time from 250 ms to under 150 ms under peak loads.

- Implemented database sharding and optimization techniques, which improved database performance and reduced latency. These enhancements reduced average query execution time from 500 ms to 300 ms, significantly enhancing user experience and handling increased data loads more effectively.

- Developed and integrated features into accounting software for generating quotations, managing electronic billing, and producing comprehensive financial reports using SQL for data management and automated scripting. This led to a 40% reduction in manual data entry through improved data automation and a 25% increase in user productivity.
