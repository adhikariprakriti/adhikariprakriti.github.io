**Research Interests**: 
Software Engineering, Web Accessibility, Machine Learning, Algorithms,Data Science

My research works and projects include:

- Worked on developing a Spelling Checker in Nepali Language

- Explored how new building constructions impact the environment through our Urban Heat Island detection project, which uses geospatial analysis to track urban temperature changes and informs sustainable urban planning

**Current work:**

- My work focuses on creating robust digital tools that assist in archiving, analyzing, and accessing language data. This technology supports the preservation and teaching of the Myaamia language and culture, ensuring these vital resources are accessible to educators, researchers, and tribal members.

- Working on developing a middleware layer which focus on integrating assistive features directly into popular data visualization libraries such as D3.js, Plotly, and Highcharts.
