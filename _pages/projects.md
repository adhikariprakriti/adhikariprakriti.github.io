- [Nepali Spelling Checker]()<br>
Nepali Spelling Checker, detects and corrects misspelled words in the Nepali Language, especially in the health
domain. Spell checker basically involves two steps. At first, the word that needs to be corrected is detected based
on context. The context of the sentence to be corrected is determined by using the sequence-2-sequence model
based on GRU neural network architecture. And secondly, the list of candidate words for correction is generated
using the Levenshtein edit distance algorithm among which the best word is selected as the correct word for
replacement with the erroneous word.

- [Urban Heat Island Detection]()<br>
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing Urban Heat Islands (UHIs), areas within cities that experience significantly higher temperatures due to human activities and urbanization. By utilizing remote sensing technology and geographic information systems (GIS), we map temperature discrepancies across urban landscapes. This data helps inform urban planning and mitigation strategies to enhance city livability by addressing the heat disparities that affect urban environments.

- [Universal Accessibility Layer For Data Visualizations]()<br>
This project introduces a Universal Accessibility Layer for Data Visualizations, designed to make data interpretation inclusive for all users, including those with disabilities. The layer integrates with existing visualization tools to enhance features such as screen reader support, alternative text, and keyboard navigation, ensuring that data visualizations are accessible and engaging for everyone.
